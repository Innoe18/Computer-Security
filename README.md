An explanation of how the programme works The main method of the program calls the menu system which allows user to sect 3 options with the first being encryption. When called the corresponding

method from the encrypt class is executed . The method uses the try catch blocks to catch any errors that may occur during the encryption process of a file

User is prompted to enter file name If file is not found then an error message is displayed and program exists method back to the menu When file is found the process begins An IV which is (initialisation vector)is generated using the secureRandom to ensure that the encrypted message is always unique even file contents and key are the same by adding random 16 byte long value at the beginning of the message The IV is essential for security in cipher block chaining The IvParameterSpec is a Java class provided in the Javax.crypto.spec package that we imported It wraps the IV into an object that can be used by the Cipher class A random key is then generated using the AES algorithm which will be used to encrypt the file . The key is generated using the key generator class The key is 128 bits long A cipher instance is created for AES encryption in Cipher Block Chaining mode (CBC) which increases security by linking each cipher text block to the previous block PKCS5Padding makes sure that the plaintext length is a multiple of the block size by adding padding The cipher is initialised in encryption mode with the generated secret key and the IV spec A new byte array is created to store the IV at the beginning of, followed by the file data which is the cipher text The Iv ensure s that the decryption process can be performed correctly later A try catch is used to make sure that the output stream is closed automatically The secret key raw bytes are encoded into a Base64 string for safe storage or sharing as base 64 ensures that the key can be stored as a readable and portable string Key is printed so that user is able to store in in a safe place to use for decryption The encryption method is over here Decryption method

The method is called from menu option 2 and in this method

Use is prompted to enter name of file they want to decrypt If file does not exist an error message is displayed and the program exists the method The extraction of the IV takes place here The first 16 bytes of the file represent the IV The first 16 bytes of the file represent the initialisation vector which is required for decrypting The bytes are copied into a new array called IV using system.arraycopy The IV is critical for decryption because it ensures that the cipher text can be correctly decrypted to mathematically the original plaintext The IVParameter wraps the UV making it compatible with the cipher class for decrypting The remaining bytes after the UV represent the cipher text which is the encrypted portion of the file Creation of a cipher object configured for AES encryption in the CBC mode with PKCS5 padding The cipher is initialised in decryption mode using the Base64 decoded secret key and the wrapped IV Decryption of the cipher text and the resulting plaintext is returned as a byte array Plaintext data is written to a new file named plaintext.txt The try catch blot ensures that errors like invalid keys , corrupt files or miss inputs are gracefully managed
